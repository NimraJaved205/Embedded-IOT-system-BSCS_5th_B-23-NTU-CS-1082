Title: LED Mode Controller with OLED Display


##  Project Description

Project Overview

Demonstrates multiple LED control modes using an ESP32.

Includes real-time status display on an OLED screen.

ðŸ”¹ Input Controls

Push Button 1: Cycles through different LED modes.

Push Button 2: Resets the system to the default OFF mode.

ðŸ”¹ OLED Display Features

Shows the current LED mode.

Displays header information and pin mapping for clarity.

ðŸ”¹ LED Control

Each LED mode uses PWM channels for brightness control.

Enables smooth fading effects and variable intensity.

##  LED Modes

| Mode | Description                      |
|------|----------------------------------|
| 0    | All LEDs OFF                     |
| 1    | Alternate LED blinking sequence  |
| 2    | All LEDs ON                      |
| 3    | PWM Fade(Cross-fade between LEDs)|
 
##  Features

- Uses Adafruit SSD1306 OLED library for clear UI.  
- Includes PWM fade effect using hardware PWM channels of ESP32.  
- Debounced button input handling.  
- OLED UI Frame shows header, mode, and pin hints.  
- Works perfectly on Wokwi simulator and physical ESP32 board.
