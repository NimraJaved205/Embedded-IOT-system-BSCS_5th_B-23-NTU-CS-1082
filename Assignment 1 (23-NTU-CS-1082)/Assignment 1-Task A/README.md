Title: LED Mode Controller with OLED Display


##  Project Description

Project Overview

Demonstrates multiple LED control modes using an ESP32.

Includes real-time status display on an OLED screen.

üîπ Input Controls

Push Button 1: Cycles through different LED modes.

Push Button 2: Resets the system to the default OFF mode.

üîπ OLED Display Features

Shows the current LED mode.

Displays header information and pin mapping for clarity.

üîπ LED Control

Each LED mode uses PWM channels for brightness control.

Enables smooth fading effects and variable intensity.

##  LED Modes

| Mode | Description |
|------|--------------|
| 0 | All LEDs OFF |
| 1 | Alternate LED blinking sequence |
| 2 | All LEDs ON |
| 3 | PWM Fade (Cross-fade between LEDs) |

##  Features

- Uses Adafruit SSD1306 OLED library for clear UI.  
- Includes PWM fade effect using hardware PWM channels of ESP32.  
- Debounced button input handling.  
- OLED UI Frame shows header, mode, and pin hints.  
- Works perfectly on Wokwi simulator and physical ESP32 board.
